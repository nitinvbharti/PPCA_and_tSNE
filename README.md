# PPCA_and_tSNE
Using PPCA for image construction and tSNE for reduction of features of images.

1. Using PPCA to learn latent features of an image and using the latent features to reconstruct the image. 
2. Using tSNE to convert 10000 MNIST images to 2 dimensions and using K-means clustering to find the clusters. 
3. Comparing the result from tSNE with PCA to see which works better.
